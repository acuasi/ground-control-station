## Poker Flat Ground Control Station

UAV ground station software emphasizing data collection and mission operations.

### Installation (for development)

#### Prerequisites

You need ```git```, ```node```, ```npm``` (distributed with node, usually), and ```grunt```.  On OSX, [install Node.js from an installer](http://nodejs.org/#download), then the rest with brew and npm:

```
brew install git
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```

#### Running

After installing prerequisites, clone this project and install dependencies, then build runtime files with ```grunt```:

```
git clone git@github.com:acuasi/ground-control-station.git
npm install
grunt
```

### Configuration

Work in progress, you need to specify the connection type in the ```config.json``` file at the root of the project (copy/paste the ```config.json.example``` file as a template), and update the relevant fields (host, port, serial device, etc).

### Running the project

Running the project has two parts: starting the node server process, and launching the grunt watcher process.  This kicks off a new build anytime any files that are used by the client are modified -- it takes a few moments, so when you save the file, it may be a few seconds before your changes are visibile in the restarted node process.

```bash
nodemon server.js &
grunt
```

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used as the Javascript build system, and our build file (```grunt.js```) is a work in progress.  [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) handles the heavy lifting on the client side, and [express](http://expressjs.com/) is the routing architecture/middleware manager on the server.

### Development
(OSX) You'll need to install the [FTDI Arduino MegaPilot driver](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) before the system will recognize the system.

if connecting via the usb, be sure to set the baudrate in config.json:

```json
{
  ...
  "baudrate" : 115200
  ...
}
```

Many things are dependent upon the build cycle, so you usually want to have this running:

```bash
grunt && grunt watch
```

#### Using SITL on a remote host

Assuming you're able to get the [SITL guide on this page](http://dev.ardupilot.com/software-in-the-loop-sitl/) running, here's how to connect this ground station to that SITL/JBSim instance pair.  For this setup, we won't have MAVProxy in the loop.  On the machine running the simulation, you need to ensure that you can access some TCP port (by default, ArduPilot will use 5760) from wherever the ground station is running.

 1. Start the ArduPlane simulator: ```/tmp/ArduPlane.build/ArduPlane.elf &```
 2. Start JSBSim: ```python ./ardupilot/Tools/autotest/jsbsim/runsim.py --home=-35.362938,149.165085,584,270 &```
 3. Change the config file for your ground station to be ```tcp```, and to connect to the correct IP/port on  the machine running the ArduPlane and JSBSim.
 4. Start the ground station: ```grunt && nodemon server.js```
 5. Open a web page to ```localhost:3000```

### Testing

#### Configuration on Jenkins

The ```config.json.example``` file is used to configure Jenkins' runtime environment.  It's copied to ```config.json```, so that file needs to be updated as appropriate if new config options are added.  For testing, the important configuration at this time is the location of the virtual serial ports.

#### Running tests

Some additional prerequsites may be required:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

There's two different collections of test suites: ones that run on the server, and ones that run on the GUI/interface layer.  Mocha is used for the server-side tests, Jasmine for the GUI layer.

To run server-side (mocha) tests in the development environment:

```bash
mocha test
```

To run Mocha tests for xunit output (for CI/Jenkins):

```bash
mocha --reporter xunit test/mocha
```

To run client-side Jasmine tests, open a web browser and open the ```test/jasmine/index.html``` HTML page.
